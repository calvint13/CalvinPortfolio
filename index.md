## Analysis and Prediction of LeBron James' Regular Season Performance

Conducted an in-depth analysis of LeBron James' regular season statistics from 2010 to 2023, including games played, minutes, points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and free throw percentage. Implemented machine learning techniques to handle missing data for the years 2018-2019 and 2020-2023. Utilized the Facebook Prophet model to predict missing values in points and other statistics, visualizing trends and predictions using Matplotlib for clear presentation.

# [Insurance Analysis](https://github.com/calvint13/Insurance_Project)

This analysis of the Medical Cost Personal Datasets showcases my skills in data exploration and analysis. Through thorough examination and statistical testing, I uncovered insights into insurance pricing dynamics, identifying influential factors such as age, BMI, and smoking habits. Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy, alongside Linear Regression models, I ensured accurate interpretation and visualization of the data, fostering fairness and equity in insurance pricing strategies.

# [School Projects](https://github.com/calvint13/School_Projects)

These school projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. I classified vegetable images using custom and transfer learning models, predicted tech workers' compensation with regression techniques, and detected fraud in transaction data with neural networks. I handled imbalanced datasets, performed feature engineering, and optimized models through hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining clear and organized code.
