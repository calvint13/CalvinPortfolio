# [School Projects](https://github.com/calvint13/School_Projects)

These school projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. I classified vegetable images using custom and transfer learning models, predicted tech workers' compensation with regression techniques, and detected fraud in transaction data with neural networks. I handled imbalanced datasets, performed feature engineering, and optimized models through hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining clear and organized code.
