# Data Analytics Projects

# School Projects (https://github.com/calvint13/School_Projects)

These projects were completed as part of my  Nait Data Analytics Program assignments, showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. In the Veggie Classification project, I used both custom and transfer learning models to classify images of vegetables. For the Regression project, I predicted total compensation for workers, employing various regression techniques and data preprocessing methods. In the Simple Neural Networks project, I developed models to predict fraud from transaction data, handling imbalanced datasets and performing feature engineering. These projects highlight the following skills: NLP techniques, exploratory data analysis, model optimization, and hyperparameter tuning, while ensuring clear and organized code structure.
